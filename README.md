# implementing_classification_models
We have to classify if the user buys a suv or not, this is a simple classification problem and the dataset used is Social_Network_Ads dataset.
About the dataset:
The dataset have five columns which are User ID,Gender,Age,EstimatedSalary,Purchased and more than 400 rows. 0 in purchased column corresponds to a user who have not bought a suv and 1 vice versa
Models like logistic regression, naive bayes, kernel_svm, decision tree and random forest have been applied to the same dataset for a comparitive study and better understanding of classification technique.
The steps in the project are same as that in any of the data science project which includes:
1-Importing necessary libraries and dataset
2-Splitting the dataset into test-train dataset with an optimal ratio
3-Rescaling/Standardizing the data(feature scaling and preprocessing)
4-Fitting the model on the training dataset
5-Visualization 
6-Accuracy- here confusion matrix is used to measure how good the model is
